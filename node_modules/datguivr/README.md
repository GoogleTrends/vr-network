# dat.GUI for VR

![Preview](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.guiVR/raw/master/preview.gif)

A flexible graphical user interface for changing variables within WebVR. Rather than jumping in an out to adjust variables in your code, tweak them at run-time within VR.

Inspired by the original [dat-gui](https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage) and built on top of [THREE.js](http://threejs.org/).

# Build and Run 
If you are using npm modules and want to use this library, contribute, or test:

    npm install
    npm run dev

Wait for the build to complete and a test server will start.

## Examples
Then navigate to **localhost:8000** on a VR enabled browser.



## Notes 
* This module assumes the existence of THREE.js in global scope somewhere.
* Can be used as a drop in script include (like the examples) or as an  ES6 module / node build.
